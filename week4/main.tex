\section{Lec Mon, 1c}
\subsection{a}
Since each term is the product of $x^a, y^b, z^c$, and $a+b+c = 2020$, we can simplify this problem into dogs and biscuits. $\binom{2020+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{2022}{2}$

\subsection{b}
Before combining, we expand each term by picking one variable from each of the 2020 $(x+y+z)$ multiplied together. So we have $3^2020$.

\subsection{c}
We can reach the same result by subtracting the amount where there is only $x$, or only $y$, or only $z$, or $xy$, $xz$, $yz$.
\newline
For the first three, there is only 1 way for that to happen since that variable has to be raised to 2020. For $xz$, we have $a+b = 2020$, feeding 2018 biscuits to 2 dogs. We need to subtract 2 since we have already counted having only one term. Therefore $\binom{2018+2-1}{2-1} = 2019$.
\newline
Adding them together we have $1 \times 3 + 2019 \times 3 = 6060$
