\section{Mon Lec, 4c}
Non of the number repeating means that it is a rearrangement of the set of remainders $\{1,2,...6\}$. We first show that if $a \not \equiv b \bmod 7, \text{then} 4a \not \equiv 4b \bmod 7$
\newline
Proof:
Suppose for contradiction that $4a \equiv 4b \bmod 7$, then we have $7 \mid 4(a-b)$. Since $\gcd(4,7)=1$, $7 \mid a-b$, $a \equiv b \bmod 7$, \lightning. We have a contradiction, therefore $4a \not \equiv 4b \bmod 7$
\newline
Let $a=1, b = 2,3,4,5,6$. We can see that $(4 \times 1)...(4 \times 6) \equiv 6! \bmod 7$. Since 6! is coprime with 7, we can divide it, leaving us with
$$4^6 \equiv 1 \bmod 7$$

\section{Mon Lec, 5a}
Using the formula
$$\phi(n) = n \prod _{p \mid n}(1-\frac{1}{p})$$
$$\phi(10) = 10(1-\frac{1}{2})(1-\frac{1}{5}) = 4$$

\section{Mon Lec, 6}
We simplify
$$\frac{x+2k}{3} \leq x+1$$
$$x+2k \leq 3x+3$$
$$2x \geq 2k-3$$
$$x \geq \frac{2k-3}{2}$$
So $(2k-3)/2 = 3, 2k = 9, k = 4.5$

\section{Mon Dis, 2b}
$$17 ^ {1707} \bmod 11 \equiv 6^{1707}\bmod 11$$
By fermats little theorem $6^10 \equiv 1 \bmod 11$
$$6^1707 \equiv (6^10)^170 \times 6^7 \bmod 11 \equiv 6^7 \bmod 11$$
Now we start raising 6 to higher powers.
$$6^2 \equiv 3 \bmod 11$$
$$6^4 \equiv 9 \bmod 11$$
$$6^7 \equiv 3\times9\times6 \bmod 11 \equiv 8 \bmod 11$$
So $17 ^ {1707} \equiv 8 \bmod 11$

\section{Mon Dis, 4c}
We first compute $\phi(100)$
$$\phi(100)=100(1-\frac{1}{2})(1-\frac{1}{5}) = 40$$
Since $\gcd(43,100)=1$, we can apply Euler Totient theorem.
$$43^{1763} \equiv (43^{40}){44} \times 43^3 \equiv 43^3 \bmod 100$$
$43^2 = 1849 \equiv 49 \bmod 100$, so $43^3 \equiv 49 \times 43 \bmod 100$
Finally we get $43^3 \equiv 7 \bmod 100$

\section{Wed Lec, 2a}
We factor the expression into $n(n^2-1)=n(n+1)(n-1)$
\newline
Integers that are divisible by 2 are spaced such that there is one every other, and those divisible by 3 are spaced such that there is one every third. Here we have a product of 3 consecutive integers, so there must be at least 1 integer between $n-1, n, n+1$ that is divisible by 2, and at least 1 that is divisible by 3. Since $6=2 \times 3$, we have $6 \mid n(n+1)(n+2)$.
\newline
Thus we have proven that $6 \mid n^3-n$
\newline
$\blacksquare$

\section{Wed Lec, $2021^{4042} \bmod 100$}
First we since 2021 is odd and does not end in 5 or 0, $\gcd(2021,100)=1$, so we can apply the Euler Totient Theorem.
$$\phi(100)=100(1-\frac{1}{2})(1-\frac{1}{5}) = 40$$
$$2021^{4042} \equiv (2021^{40})101 \times 2021^2 \equiv 2021^2 \equiv 21^2 \bmod 100$$
Now we can simply calculate the square to be $441 \equiv 41 \bmod 100$
\newpage


\section{Wed Dis 1a}
First we show that $17n^2+1 \not \equiv 0 \bmod 4$
\newline
$17n^2+1 \equiv n^2+1 \bmod 4$ Now we assume that there exists some $n \geq 1$ that sataisfies this equation. Then we have $n^2+1 \equiv 0 \bmod 4$
$$n^2 \equiv 3 \bmod 4$$
Now we consider all the possibilities of $n \mod 4$: $1^2 \equiv 1, 2^2 \equiv 0, 3^3 \equiv 1, 4^2 \equiv 0 (\bmod 5)$. Therefore there is no way $n$ that sataisfies $n^2\equiv 3$. Our assumption is incorrect and $4 \not \mid 17n^2+1$
\newline
We repeat the proof for $\bmod 5$
\newline
$17n^2+1 \equiv 2n^2+1 \bmod 5$ We assume that there exists some $n \geq 1$ that sataisfies this equation. Then we have $2n^2+1 \equiv 0 \bmod 5$
$$2n^2 \equiv 4 \bmod 5$$
$$n^2 \equiv 2 \bmod 5$$
We can examine the possible squares: $1^2 \equiv 1, 2^2 \equiv 4, 3^2 \equiv 4, 4^2 \equiv 1 (\bmod 5)$ Once again there is no possible way for $n^2$ to be 2. Our assumption is incorrect and $5 \not \mid 17n^2+1$
\newline
Thus we have proven both parts of the hypothesis.
$\blacksquare$

\section{Wed Dis, 5}
$n \equiv$ the sum of its digits modulo 9 because when in decimal, we can express $n = \sum 10^kd$, where d is the digit at the kth place. We know that $10^k \equiv 1(\bmod 9)$, so each digit is equivalent to being multiplied by 1, which is just itself.
\newline
For this problem we take the modulo of $9$, which as shown above is the sum of all the digits. We can then find which one is missing based on the fact that the sum is $45$.
\newline
By Fermat's Little Theorem $2^8 \equiv 1 \bmod 9$
$$2^29 \equiv (2^{8})^3 \times 2^5 \equiv 2^5 \bmod 9$$
We can then compute the rest by brute force: $2^5 = 32 \equiv 5 \bmod 9$
\newline
Since the sum is $45 \equiv 0 \bmod 9$, having a remainder of $5$ means that we are missing its complement: $9-5=4$.
\newline
Therefore $2^29$ is missing the number $4$.

\section{Fri Lec, 2c}
In this process we can see that the invariant is the oddity of the 1's. Since $(0,0)
\to 0, (1,1)\to 0, (2,2)\to 0, (0,1) \to 1, (0,2)\to 1, (1,2)\to 1$, we can see that either we remove
