\section{Wed Lec, 1a}
Prove that $\binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k+1} = \binom{n+1}{k+1}$
\subsection{algebraic}
We first expand the expression:
$$LHS = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} + \frac{n!}{(n-k-1)!(k+1)!}$$
Then we simplify:
$$LHS = \frac{n!}{(n-k)(n-k-1)!k!} + \frac{n!}{(k+1)(n-k-1)!k!}$$
$$LHS = \frac{(n!(k+1))+(n!(n-k))}{(n-k)(k+1)(n-k-1)!k!} $$
$$LHS = \frac{n!(n+1)}{(k+1)!(n-k)!} $$
$$LHS = \frac{(n+1)!}{(k+1)!(n-k)!}$$
Now we expand the right side:
$$RHS = \frac{(n+1)!}{(k+1)!(n-k)!}$$
We see thatt RHS = LHS.

Q.E.D.

\subsection{Combinatorial}
The right hand side calculates the number of bitstrings of length $n+1$ with $k+1$ 0's. Since each bit can either end in $0$ or $1$, we can split them into different cases.
\newline
If the the last is $0$, there are $k$ 0's left in the substring of length $n$. So to calculate this, we use $\binom{n}{k}$.
\newline
If the last bit is $1$, there are still $k+1$ 0's left in the substring before it. Using the formula, we get $\binom {n}{k+1}$
\newline
Adding them together equals the right hand side. They are evaluating the same thing.

Q.E.D.

\section{Wed Lec, 4b}
Let people be the pigeons and each letter is a different hole.
\newline
Number of pigeons = number of names = 33
\newline
Number of holes = number of letters - 30
\newline
Since the amount of pigeons is greater than the amount of holes, some hole must have at least 2 pigeons by PHP. Therefore some ending letter must be shared by at least 2 names.

\subsection{a}
We can form a segment from any two points. So the total amount of segments is $\binom{50}{2} = \frac{50!}{2!48!}=1225$

\subsection{b}
Since no three points are colinear, we can choose any 3 points to form a triangle. So the total amount is $\binom{50}{3} = \frac{50!}{3!47!} = 19600$

\subsection{c}
Similar to part (b), we choose any 4 points to form a quadrilateral. The total amount is $\binom {50} {4} = \frac{50!}{46!4!} = 230300$.
